WELCOME TO PROJECT CIPHER

This is a C language Project aimed at creating an encrypted data and also decrypting it. I created this program as an end-semester project in my First semester at NUST , Pakistan. 

Feel free to let me know how can I improve this program @smahmood.bscs23seecs@seecs.edu.pk 



HERE'S HOW TO RUN THIS PROGRAM: 

1. First make sure the project file and the images / text file you want to encrypt are in same folder. Otherwise you'll have to copy the path to encrypt / decrypt them.

2. Run the program .

3. HURAAYYYYY !!!!  The file / image / text is encrypted or decrypted.
